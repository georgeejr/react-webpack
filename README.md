## Functional Design
* Why Webpack 2? Because Webpack is the new javascript module bundler that lets you import files and bundles everything together. So on the page you are just including 1 file and all the necessary parts of your javascript application or site are bundled together into 1 file. Webpack makes your development and production very fast and maintainable.
